After figuring out the last problem our developers decided to refactor our code, but yet again they are running into some roadblocks! 

### Challenges

- Figure out what went wrong
- Explain the difference between `include` and `extend`
- Explain what is a "singleton class"

### Instructions

Navigate the code with 'next', 'step' or 'continue'.

- next: jumps to the next line of the code
- step: jumps inside a method
- continue: keeps the program execution until it finds another breakpoint

### New concepts

- Information.singleton_class.ancestors
