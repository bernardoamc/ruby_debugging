Let's ship our org chart! Every team in our company owns a single class, but now we don't know which class we should call! 

### Challenges

- This is becoming complex, can you find out the proper method to log our code?

### Instructions

Navigate the code with 'next', 'step' or 'continue'.

- next: jumps to the next line of the code
- step: jumps inside a method
- continue: keeps the program execution until it finds another breakpoint

### New concepts

- information.methods - 1.methods
- information.methods.grep /something/
