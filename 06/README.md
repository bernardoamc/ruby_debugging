# Our developers have decided to refactor our code, can you figure out what went wrong?

### Challenges

- Figure out what went wrong
- Explain what `Information < CoolLogger` means

### Instructions

Navigate the code with 'next', 'step' or 'continue'.

- next: jumps to the next line of the code
- step: jumps inside a method
- continue: keeps the program execution until it finds another breakpoint

### Useful concepts

- Information.singleton_class.ancestors
- Information.method(:log).super_method.source_location
