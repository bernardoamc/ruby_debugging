Our developers thought that over abstracting certain concepts would make the code more clear (??) but it seems something went wrong!

### Challenges

- What is going on with our `display_info` method?
- Explain how the `include` keyword works
- Explain how the `super` keyword works

### Instructions

Navigate the code with 'next', 'step' or 'continue'.

- next: jumps to the next line of the code
- step: jumps inside a method
- continue: keeps the program execution until it finds another breakpoint

### Useful concepts

- Information.ancestors

### New concepts

- information.method(:display_info).super_method.source_location
- backtrace
- caller
