Tired to format the data themselves our developers decided to use a dependency, but something went terribly wrong.

### Challenges

There are two ways to solve this problem, can you figure it out?

### Instructions

Navigate the code with 'next', 'step' or 'continue'.

- next: jumps to the next line of the code
- step: jumps inside a method
- continue: keeps the program execution until it finds another breakpoint

### New concepts

- information.method(:display_info).source_location
- Information.ancestors
