Alright, the previous approach did not work for our company. We all know that we should simplify things, it just took us awhile to figure out the right way to do it.

### Challenges

- Figure out what went wrong
- Explain the difference between passing `true` or `false` to methods like:
    * instance_methods
    * public_methods
    * private_methods

### Instructions

Navigate the code with 'next', 'step' or 'continue'.

- next: jumps to the next line of the code
- step: jumps inside a method
- continue: keeps the program execution until it finds another breakpoint

### New concepts

- Information.instance_methods(false)
- information.public_methods(false)
- information.private_methods(false)
