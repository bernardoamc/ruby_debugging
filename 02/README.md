Our developers have decided to use a class to format our information, but they got something wrong. Can you help them fix it?

### Challenges

1. Fix the problem
2. Explain the `instance variables` concept and how it works

### Instructions

Navigate the code with 'next', 'step' or 'continue'.

- next: jumps to the next line of the code
- step: jumps inside a method
- continue: keeps the program execution until it finds another breakpoint

### New concepts

- information.instance_variables
