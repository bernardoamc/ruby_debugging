It seems like our `format_info` method is not printing our information correctly.

### Challenges

- Familiarize yourself with the debugger
- Figure out what went wrong

### Instructions

Navigate the code with `next`, `step` or `continue`.

- next: jumps to the next line of the code
- step: jumps inside a method
- continue: keeps the program execution until it finds another breakpoint
